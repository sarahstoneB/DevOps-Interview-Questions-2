# AWS Questions

### General Questions

##### What is an IAM Role?
  An IAM role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions for making AWS service requests.
  IAM roles are not associated with a specific user or group. Instead, trusted entities assume roles, such as IAM users, applications, or AWS services such as EC2.

##### What is a NAT Gateway?

A network address translation (NAT) gateway is used to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. NAT gateways are created in a public subnet.
